## Python for Algorithmic Trading

Finding the right algorithm to automatically and successfully trade in financial markets is the _holy grail in finance_. Not too long ago, **Algorithmic Trading** was only available for institutional players with deep pockets and lots of assets under management. Recent developments in the areas of open source, open data, cloud compute and storage as well as online trading platforms have leveled the playing field for smaller institutions and individual traders -- making it possible to get started in this fascinating discipline being equipped with a modern notebook and an Internet connection only.

Nowadays, **Python** and its eco-system of powerful packages is the technology platform of choice for algorithmic trading. Among others, Python allows you to do _efficient data analytics_ (with e.g. http://pandas.pydata.org), to apply _machine learning_ to stock market prediction (with e.g. http://scikit-learn.org) or even make use of Google's _deep learning_ technology (with http://tensorflow.org).
